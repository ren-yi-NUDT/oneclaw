# Common Gotchas

Things that are easy to get wrong or forget when working on OneClaw.

1. **`npm install file:` creates symlinks, not copies.** Always use `--install-links` for physical copy. This is critical for electron-builder packaging.

2. **Cross-platform build needs re-packaging.** After switching target platform, `npm run package:resources` must run again because the Node.js binary and native modules differ per platform.

3. **All Kimi sub-platforms use unified config.** All three (moonshot-cn, moonshot-ai, kimi-code) write `apiKey` + `baseUrl` + `api` + `models` to `models.providers`. No special-casing.

4. **Health check timeout is 90 seconds.** This is intentionally long for Windows. Don't reduce it without testing on slow machines.

5. **Tray app behavior.** Closing the window hides it; the app stays in the tray. `Cmd+Q` (or Quit from tray menu) actually quits. macOS Dock icon hides automatically when no windows are visible.

6. **macOS signing.** By default uses ad-hoc identity (`-`). Set `ONECLAW_MAC_SIGN_AND_NOTARIZE=true` + `CSC_NAME`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER` in `.env` for real signing.

7. **Version is auto-derived from git tag.** Format: `YYYY.MMDD.N` (e.g. `v2026.318.0`). `package.json` stays `0.0.0-dev`; CI extracts version from tag via `npm version`. Never manually edit `package.json` version.

8. **No local upstream directory needed.** openclaw is installed from npm directly during `package:resources`. The `upstream/` directory is no longer required.

9. **Blockmap generation is disabled.** Both DMG and NSIS have blockmap/differential disabled to avoid unnecessary `.blockmap` files.

10. **macOS auto-update requires ZIP.** electron-updater needs the ZIP artifact, not DMG. Both are built: DMG for manual distribution, ZIP for auto-update.

11. **`OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1` is required.** All child processes (gateway, doctor, CLI) must set this env var to prevent subprocess self-respawning, which causes console window flickering on Windows.

12. **Gateway entry fallback.** `resolveGatewayEntry()` tries `openclaw.mjs` first (new packages), then falls back to `gateway-entry.mjs` (legacy). Both paths must be considered during packaging verification.

13. **CLI wrapper uses RC block markers.** Install/uninstall is idempotent via `# >>> oneclaw-cli >>>` / `# <<< oneclaw-cli <<<` markers in shell profiles. Always check for marker presence before modifying.

14. **Kimi Search API key is a sidecar file**, not in `openclaw.json`. Stored at `~/.openclaw/credentials/kimi-search-api-key`. Auto-reuses kimi-code provider key if no dedicated key exists.

15. **AGENTS.md is a symlink to CLAUDE.md.** Don't create separate content — they share the same file.

16. **Gateway port is configurable.** Resolution order: env `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` > config `gateway.port` in `openclaw.json` > default `18789`. Don't hardcode port numbers — use `resolveGatewayPort()` from `constants.ts`.

17. **Gateway npm update check is disabled.** OneClaw writes `update.checkOnStart = false` to the gateway config at startup. The gateway cannot self-update inside a packaged Electron app.

18. **`oneclaw.config.json` is the ownership marker.** OneClaw uses this file to detect config ownership at startup. Detection flow: `oneclaw.config.json` exists → normal startup; `.device-id` exists → legacy migration; `openclaw.json` exists without marker → external OpenClaw takeover; nothing → fresh Setup. Do not delete this file manually.

19. **Skill store config is standalone.** Registry URL stored in `~/.openclaw/skill-store.json`, not in gateway config. Skills installed to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`, not `~/.openclaw/skills/`.

20. **CLI wrapper invokes bundled Node.js.** The wrapper scripts use the real bundled Node.js binary from the app package, not the system node.

21. **Token injection uses URL fragment.** Gateway auth token is passed via `#token=...` in the loaded URL, not query parameter or localStorage.

22. **Build config replaces analytics config.** `build-config.json` (renamed from `analytics-config.json`) is injected at build time and read by `build-config.ts`. Contains PostHog key, clawhub registry, and other build constants.

23. **Gateway ASAR mode requires patched boundary check.** `package-resources.js` patches openclaw's `openBoundaryFileSync()` to skip validation for `.asar` paths. Without this patch, the plugin security check rejects ASAR virtual paths and gateway fails to start.

24. **ASAR mode changes path resolution.** `resolveGatewayRoot()` auto-detects `gateway.asar` vs `gateway/` directory. ASAR mode: `resolveGatewayCwd()` returns `~/.openclaw/` (OS can't chdir into ASAR). Gateway subprocess uses Electron binary + `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` to read ASAR transparently. CLI interactive mode on Windows requires a CONSOLE subsystem binary (Electron is GUI subsystem, cannot hold interactive TTY).

25. **Windows uses assisted installer.** NSIS `oneClick: false` mode enables installation directory selection and custom uninstall options. `installer.nsh` provides CLI cleanup and user data removal checkboxes. `createDesktopShortcut: "always"` ensures shortcut is recreated on update.

26. **Windows CLI wrapper lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OneClaw\bin\`.** Not in `~/.openclaw/bin/` like POSIX. Legacy path migration handles old users who had wrappers in `~/.openclaw/bin/`.

27. **Client-side polling uses shared ticker.** All periodic polling in Chat UI must go through the 60s `client-ticker.ts` mechanism (`registerTickHandler`/`unregisterTickHandler`). Do not create standalone `setInterval` calls. See [client-ticker.md](client-ticker.md).

28. **Tooltips must use the global fixed-position approach.** Never use CSS `::after` pseudo-elements for tooltips — they get clipped by any parent with `overflow: auto/hidden`. Use the shared `.fixed-tooltip` DOM element with JS event delegation (`mouseover` + `getBoundingClientRect()`). Chat UI initializes it in `main.ts`, Settings in `settings.js`. Just add `data-tooltip="text"` to any element. Use `data-tooltip-pos="bottom"` for downward tooltips.

29. **Design tokens are the single source of truth.** All CSS variables (colors, radii, shadows, fonts, transitions) live in `shared/design-tokens.css`. Chat UI, Settings, and Setup all `@import` this file. Never hardcode color values or `border-radius` in component styles — use tokens. Never use `transition: all` — specify exact properties.

30. **Scrollbars must use native overlay behavior — declare nothing.** Any scrollbar styling forces Chromium out of overlay mode on macOS, making scrollbars permanently visible. This includes both `::-webkit-scrollbar{,-thumb,-track}` AND the standard `scrollbar-width` / `scrollbar-color` properties when set to concrete values. The only way to preserve the native "show on scroll, auto-hide when idle" behavior is to not declare any scrollbar rules at all. `scrollbar-width: none` is still allowed for places that intentionally hide the scrollbar (like the nav bar).
